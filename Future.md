Here's a structured plan to enhance your Financial Planning App with the specified features and improvements. This plan includes the key steps without diving into the specific coding details.

### Steps to Enhance the Financial Planning App

#### 1. **Refactor Project Structure**
- **Components Directory**: Organize reusable Streamlit components (AgGrid, Plotly events, Lottie animations).
- **Pages Directory**: Separate the functionality into distinct pages for better code organization.
- **Utils Directory**: Include utility functions and modules for data handling, API integrations, and authentication.

#### 2. **Dashboard and User Interface**
- **Personalized Dashboard**:
    - Create a dashboard page displaying financial summaries, upcoming events, and recent activities.
    - Utilize Streamlit’s built-in graphing functions and additional libraries (Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Altair) for interactive and static visualizations.
- **Dark Mode and Theme Customization**:
    - Implement dark mode and various themes using CSS files.
    - Allow users to toggle themes via the sidebar.
- **UI Enhancements**:
    - Use `streamlit-extras` for additional UI features.
    - Integrate `streamlit-lottie` for animations to make the UI more engaging.

#### 3. **Financial Calculations and Simulations**
- **Modular Functions**:
    - Develop functions for financial calculations (budget vs. actual, debt management, investment simulation).
    - Ensure these functions are reusable and modular.
- **Data Manipulation**:
    - Use `numpy` and `pandas` for efficient data handling and calculations.

#### 4. **Interactive Visualizations**
- **Interactive Tables**:
    - Integrate `streamlit-aggrid` for interactive data tables.
- **Clickable Charts**:
    - Use `streamlit-plotly-events` for interactive Plotly charts that respond to user actions.
- **Advanced Visualizations**:
    - Implement `bokeh` for interactive visualizations.
    - Utilize `pydeck` for map-based visualizations.

#### 5. **Reports and Data Export**
- **Report Generation**:
    - Implement functionalities to generate customizable financial reports in PDF and CSV formats.
    - Use libraries like `reportlab` or `pdfkit` for creating PDF reports.

#### 6. **Advanced Features**
- **Machine Learning and AI Integration**:
    - Integrate external ML libraries like Hugging Face for predictive modeling.
    - Use OpenAI’s GPT models for AI-driven financial advice and insights.
- **Additional Components**:
    - Add components for goal tracking, debt management, and financial insights.

- Use `numpy` and `pandas` for efficient data manipulation.

#### Interactive Visualizations
- Integrate `streamlit-aggrid` for interactive tables.
- Implement `streamlit-plotly-events` for interactive charts.
- Use `bokeh` and `pydeck` for advanced visualizations.

#### Reports and Data Export
- Develop functionalities to generate financial reports.
- Use `reportlab` or `pdfkit` for PDF generation.
- Provide options to export data in CSV format.

#### Advanced Features
- Integrate Hugging Face models for financial predictions.
- Use OpenAI's GPT for generating financial advice.
